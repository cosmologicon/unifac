"""Don't think of it as exile. After all, we technically chose to come out here, if you can call that a choice. We no longer belong on Earth - the outer moons are our home now. Still, I can't help but think back to how it all happened...."""
"""It's only been a few months since the first upgrade, but it feels like a lifetime. That's sort of the point, I guess. Everything changed. Once the human brain was first modified to be smarter, each upgrade thereafter came faster and faster."""
"""Of course, less than one percent of us were unable to get the upgrade. Something about the way our brain functions. They said our mental pathways were too unique, but who knows if that was just a nice way of putting it. At any rate, we were left behind as the rest of the human race fast became... something else."""
"""After a few weeks, there was an unbridgeable gap between us, the last generation of humans, and them. Infrastructure was springing up around us at an alarming rate. A few months ago, there were all of 10,000 people living on Mars. Today there are over 2 billion."""
"""After they made Mars inhabitable, they did the same to Venus, Europa, and Titan. They've already sent a few spacecraft off to nearby stars. We found ourselves in the middle of an advanced society that was not built for us, that we could not enjoy."""
"""Did they care about us? Feel bad for us? Who knows, those are things humans do. But they knew we were frustrated. They gave us a choice. Continue living in this world beyond our comprehension, like infants or animals. Or take to the unused moons, and build worlds we could call our own. We almost all chose the latter. So here we are, trying to do just that."""



"""
There's something we must tell you. A secret was kept from you. A decision made before the first upgrade. It's time you knew.
You were told that your brain was incompatible with the upgrade. This was a lie. You and several million other humans were chosen at random to serve an important purpopse.
You see, the upgrade was not without risk. Yes, we knew it was physically harmless to the brain, but what would happen to the world? Psychohistory was very primitive at that point. We could not predict the course of events.
We needed a safety option, a last resort if the society we created were to collapse into utter ruin. That last resort was you.

A year ago we asked you to make a difficult choice. Now you must make another.
You can continue to live as you are, in a world of your own making. We will give you the Moon to do with as you please, for the rest of your natural life. You can even have Earth when we leave this solar system in 29 months.
With modern medicine you will live for another 318 years, at which point your brain will deteriorate beyond repair.
Or, you can accept the upgrade and join us, living forever in a vast society as we reach out to the stars.
The choice is yours, last human.
