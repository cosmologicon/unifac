Collection of games made by me, Christopher Night.

Unless otherwise noted, you are welcome to use code written by me for anything. Consider the license to be WTFPL/CC0 (Creative Commons Zero). Some games include images, sounds, and library code that has other, more restrictive licensing terms, so check the README in the individual game's directory for details.

Exception: Robot Underground.


All code and assets will have some kind of open-source or Creative Commons license, so you're at least free to redistribute it.
