	[1, "m", "I know my purpose. My name is Mortimer,|and I..."],
	[1, "m", "...am a butterfly collector."],

	[2, "e", "My goodness, young man! That was|impressive butterfly collecting!"],
	[2, "e", "You remind me of myself as a lad."],
	[2, "m", "You were watching me? Who are you?"],
	[2, "e", "Maj. Gen. Elmer Wrightscoptch (Ret.),|at your service."],
	[2, "e", "I am the President of the Royal|Lepidopteral Society."],
	[2, "e", "I need someone for an extremely important|and dangerous butterfly-collecting quest."],
	[2, "e", "What say you?"],
	[2, "m", "Yes at last my dreams have come true!"],
	[2, "e", "Brilliant! You can begin by training at our|dojo. Come with me."],
	[2, "s", "Greetings, Mortimer. I am the master of|this dojo."],
	[2, "s", "Let's see what you can do."],

	[3, "s", "Well done. Excellent form."],
	[3, "s", "I declare you ready for field work."],
	[3, "e", "I can now reveal to you the nature of|your quest."],
	[3, "e", "You're embarking on a journey to find a map|to the greatest treasure in all of lepidoptery..."],
	[3, "e", "The Lost Butterfly Garden of Verdania!"],
	[3, "m", "Sounds brilliant! What is it?"],
	[3, "e", "An enchanted realm where every type of|butterfly roams freely, ripe for the collecting!"],
	[3, "e", "It's been lost for ages, but with the map,|we can revisit it!"],
	[3, "e", "We have reason to believe that half of the|map is located..."],
	[3, "e", "in the Bucolic Meadow of Doom, a few miles|from here in Northamptonford-upon-Lynshire."],
	[3, "e", "Your mission is to go there, and retrieve|the piece of the map."],
	[3, "e", "And collect some butterflies while you're|at it!"],
	[3, "m", "I won't let you down!"],

	[4, "m", "I'm back from the Bucolic Meadow of Doom!"],
	[4, "m", "I got that half of the legendary map!"],
	[4, "s", "Mortimer, thank goodness you've returned!|Terrible news!"],
	[4, "s", "President Wrightscoptch has been kidnapped|by a rival organisation..."],
	[4, "s", "The Royal Society of Lepidopterists!"],
	[4, "m", "Wait... isn't that us?"],
	[4, "s", "No you fool! We're the Royal Lepidopteral|Society!"],
	[4, "s", "There rages an ancient rivalry between|us and the Royal Society of Lepidopterists."],
	[4, "s", "Born of a dispute over who invented the|greatest advance in butterfly collecting ever."],
	[4, "m", "What advance?"],
	[4, "s", "The idea of sticking butterflies onto|poster board with a pin!"],
	[4, "m", "That's it?"],
	[4, "s", "That's a big deal!"],
	[4, "s", "Before that, everyone just threw their|butterflies into a desk drawer."],
	[4, "s", "It was a huge mess."],
	[4, "s", "First they claim credit for that, and|now they kidnap our president!"],
	[4, "m", "I'm going after him! Where can I find|them?"],
	[4, "s", "Their palace is on the other side of a|field you'll have to cross."],
	[4, "m", "A field, you say? Might this field|have any butterflies on it?"],
	[4, "s", "Probably. But you don't have to catch|the butterflies just to cross the..."],
	[4, "m", "I'll do it! And I'll catch a bunch of|butterflies on my way!"],
	[4, "s", "Sure, whatever."],

	[5, "m", "I'm Mortimer, from the Royal Lepidopteral|Society. Unhand our president!"],
	[5, "v", "Certainly... on one condition."],
	[5, "v", "Give us your half of the map to the|Lost Butterfly Garden of Verdania!"],
	[5, "e", "Don't do it Mortimer! They have the|other half of the map!"],
	[5, "v", "What do you care anyway?"],
	[5, "v", "According to legend, only the Chosen|One may enter the Lost Garden."],
	[5, "m", "The Chosen One?"],
	[5, "v", "He who would unite the clans of|lepidoptery,"],
	[5, "v", "and usher in a golden age of butterfly|collecting!"],
	[5, "m", "Oh, that Chosen One."],
	[5, "e", "Mortimer! Get out of here! Save|yourself!"],
	[5, "m", "Nothing doing. I'm here to rescue|you!"],
	[5, "v", "And how do you plan to do that?"],
	[5, "m", "The only way I know how to do|anything...."],
	[5, "m", "by catching butterflies!"],

	[6, "v", "My word.... Young man, that was|some fine netmanship."],
	[6, "v", "Perhaps we resorted to drastic|measures prematurely."],
	[6, "v", "Very well. We will release Elmer."],
	[6, "e", "You know, Victoria, we needn't|feud so."],
	[6, "e", "You have half the map, and so do we."],
	[6, "e", "Working together, we could at last|locate the Lost Garden."],
	[6, "v", "An intriguing proposition....|Yes, we have a deal."],
	[6, "v", "Mortimer, thank you dearly for bringing|us back together after so long."],
	[6, "e", "I think I speak for both of us when|I say,"],
	[6, "e", "Will you do us the honour of visiting|the Lost Garden?"],
	[6, "m", "Of course I will!|The honour is all mine!"],

	[7, "m", "What splendour! What beauty!"],
	[7, "m", "I could live my whole life here|collecting and collecting!"],
	[7, "m", "What's that sound?"],
	[7, "m", "Why are all the butterflies flying away?!"],
	[7, "m", "Oh no, the cliff wall is collapsing!"],
	[7, "m", "I've got to get out of here!"],
	[7, "e", "Mortimer! You've returned! What did|you see in the Lost Garden?"],
	[7, "m", "Well.... it was nice while it lasted."],
	[7, "e", ". . ."],
	[7, "m", "I'm afraid it's under 100 feet of|rock now."],
	[7, "m", "It was probably all that jumping|around I was doing. Terribly sorry."],
	[7, "e", "You... imbecile!"],
	[7, "e", "I hereby banish you for life from the|Royal Lepidopteral Society!"],
	[7, "e", "Get out!"],
	[7, "v", "And don't try to join the Royal|Society of Lepidopterists, either."],
	[7, "m", "Oh well. I was getting sick of|butterflies anyway."],
	[7, "m", "I think I'll take up collecting|seashells. Now there's a jolly good hobby!"],
