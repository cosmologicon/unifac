The New World, 1699

The Spanish silver dollar, known as pieces of eight, has become the first global currency. Vast amounts of silver are extracted from Spanish-controlled mines in South America, the largest treasure haul the world has ever seen. This is transported to the British West Indies and minted into dollars, known in English as eight bits. Hence galleons, heavily laden with pieces of eight, make their way north, in what is known as the Eight Bit Passage. On reaching the 32nd parallel, the prevailing westerlies grant them swift travels back to Europe.

Ships traversing the Eight Bit Passage are ripe targets for piracy, and it's your job to keep the passage clear. The smooth functioning on the Spanish Empire, and indeed the entire world, depends on it.
