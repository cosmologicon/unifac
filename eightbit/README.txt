Story
-----

The New World, 1699

Spanish silver dollars, or pieces of eight, have become the first global currency. Vast hauls of
silver are extracted from Spanish-controlled mines in South America, the largest treasure haul the
world has ever seen. This is transported to the British West Indies and minted into dollars, known
in English as eight bits. Hence galleons, heavily laden with pieces of eight, make their way north,
through what is known as the Eight Bit Passage. On reaching the 32nd parallel, the prevailing
westerlies grant them swift travels back to Europe.

Ships traversing the Eight Bit Passage are ripe targets for piracy, and it's your job to keep the
passage clear. The smooth functioning on the Spanish Empire, and indeed the entire world, depends
on it.
