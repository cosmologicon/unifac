At the turn of the 16th Century news of the New World reached Europe, and the first campaigns to create a global empire began. By 1580, the Spanish Empire spanned Africa, East Asia, and the Americas. Nothing signified Spain's reach better than Spanish dollars, used throughout the world, known as pesos de ocho, or pieces of eight. The Portuguese empire, though vast, was under the increasingly tight control of Spain. In 1640, Portugal fought back, and the War of Portuguese Restoration began.

It failed. This turn of events can be traced to the actions of a mysterious woman in strange clothing, known as Angel de la Victoria, seen advising the Spanish forces during the Battle of Montijo, and later at the Battles of Ameixal, Castelo Rodrigo, and Montes Claros. With Portugal thoroughly defeated, Spain seized control over all Portuguese overseas territories.

With the combined resources of both empires, Spain went on to quell further attempts at empire building by England, the Netherlands, and France, and continued to grow. Mexico became the American superpower, and the Phillipines became the East Asian superpower. Pieces of eight became the global currency, leading to the phrase "eight bits to the dollar" in English-speaking regions.
