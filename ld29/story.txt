100 generations ago, we left the surface of this world behind.
Using great engines known as Crafters, we excavated vast caverns in which to form a new life.
The Crafters provided everything for us, including artifical day and night.
So it was for thousands of years.
The world we left behind, the world of the surface, fell into myth, and became known as Heaven.
In time the path back to Heaven decayed, as did our technology, as did the Crafters.
At long last the final Crafter has died. There is no more day, only night.
That was 20 years ago.
We have survived as best we can, but without the Crafters, our time is limited.
You were born after the last Crafter died. You have never seen the day.
I believe our only hope is to return to Heaven, but how that may be done I do not know.
