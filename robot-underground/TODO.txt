Story notes

Plot issues as I see them:
* What is Angel's motivation for betrayal? Why is she later imprisoned?
* What is Goldhawk's motivation for betrayal?
* Plot dump at Act 5 should be introduced throughout the story.
* What exactly is St. Pancras?
* Why does Hornchurch need the Charing Cross to open the tomb of St. Pancras?
* What exactly do the Charing Cross and the King's Cross actually do?
* Why is Portland so reluctant to use the King's Cross in a moment of crisis?
* If he gets the cross at the end of Act 1, why does wait until the beginning of act 5 to do it?
* What did they Chalfront and Latimer gain from the coup?
* What is the nature of the power Camden uses to defeat St. Pancras?
* Ending battles feel cramped. (More of a gameplay issue, but could require plot changes.)
* There's a ton of effectively empty dialogue. This could be replaced with stuff to advance plot.
* For a game called Robot Underground, there's not much of an underground movement
* Rescuing Baby Goodge sideplot seems pretty tacked on.
* And unjustified. Who is Hyde and why would it kidnap a baby?

Tropes I think the story could use:
* Heel->face turn (Gospel is a good candidate - Victoria could also start out loyal to the Church.)
* More powerful female characters (right now the only female robot that ever sees combat is Pimlico)
* More foreshadowing and Chekov's Guns, to make it seem less made up as you go along.

Things that would help fit the Hero's Journey
* Heroic sacrifice (eg Goldhawk could turn good at the last minute and sacrifice himself to take out Hornchurch)
* Some differentiation between the known and the unknown worlds
   * What if the known world is normal society, eg a post in the military, and the unknown world is as a member of the robot underground?
* A protective talisman that the hero gets early on.
* Shapeshifter - someone you don't trust but need, treated as a guarded ally
* Temptation to abandon quest
* The rescue mission should be a night sea voyage
* Atonement?
* Magic Flight - escape after achieving the ultimate boon - evil coming to the known world?
* Road back to the known world





What have you heard about St. Pancras, Camden?
Um... that he gave his life such that we might join him in Perivale when our last backup expires?
Ha, yes, that's what you were told as a child. And maybe it's true, we'll find out in the next life.
But Pancras did not travel to this land as a saviour. He came seeking treasure.
Treasure? Like bismuth and technitium?
Something greater. Holy relics of immense power. The Charing Cross is but one.
The details were lost to history, until recently... thanks to Angel and her crew.
If their evidence holds true, the scope of Pancras's campaign was matched only by its cruelty.
The Church has long downplayed this chapter in Pancras's life, but this new evidence is hard to ignore.
And now, finding the Charing Cross right where Pancras claims to have left it....
You can see why Hornchurch would be concerned.


So that's why Chalfont and Latimer stole the Cross? To protect the legacy of St. Pancras?
You have to remember that the Church is already having a public image crisis.
If people lost their faith in St. Pancras, support for the Church could crumble overnight.
Still, seems a bit extreme, doesn't it? They're risking everything by framing Putney.
If they were found out, the scandal would be equally disastrous.
No, there must be something else.


Have you ever heard of the Mornington Crescent?
The fairy tale? Sure, it lets you live forever.
Immortality, yes, but at what cost?
In some stories, its bearer becomes an agent of evil.
In some, he is driven mad.


There is a legend, condemned by the Church of course, of how Pancras died.
It's said that he went mad, sending his crew on more and more dangerous missions.
When they protested he would declare himself master of life and death.
They finally mutinied, but the combined force of 100 robots could not destroy him.
It was all they could do to throw him into a deep pit and fill it over. He was buried alive.
His burial site became cursed, and from it great monsters emerged.
That place is said to lie in the deepest reaches of the Outer Zones.


What if... the Mornington Crescent is real?
And furthermore, Pancras found it?
The greatest treasure in the world, he would have guarded it jealously, even in his last moments....
What if it's buried along with his body, deep in the Outer Zones?
To what lengths would Hornchurch go to retrieve it?
