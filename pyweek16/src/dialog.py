		"This station is infested with space mold that's attracted to unlocking nodes. It'll change the colors of the contacts, and you'll have to rotate tiles to fix it. Remember to keep the large tile activated!",
		"You'll learn some defensive measures later, but for now, just fix the damage that the mold causes until the node unlocks.",
