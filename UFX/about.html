<h1>UFX: Javascript HTML5 game library</h1>

<p>UFX is a library for writing Javascript video games, comprising <a href="#modulelist">a set of
modules</a> that do various things. The modules can generally be used independently of each other.
Most modules require HTML5 and ECMAScript 5, but some can be used without full support.

<p>UFX is completely free to use however you want, and it doesn't depend on any other Javascript
frameworks.

<h2 id=shouldi>Should I use UFX?</h2>

<p>First of all, UFX is very incomplete. It's still under active development. But even once it gets
completed, you probably don't want to use the whole thing. I made some design decisions that I know
are not popular, but I prefer them.

<p>You might still find UFX useful, however, because you can use one or more modules from it without
using the rest. Modules are, for the most part, independent. They should work fine alongside other
libraries. So use whatever suits your needs.

<h2 id=howcani>How can I use UFX?</h2>

<p>I haven't worked this out yet. For now just make a copy of the source files (because APIs are
subject to change) and include them like you would any Javascript file.

<p>All UFX functionality is placed in the UFX namespace. Every module has its own namespace within
UFX that's the name of that module. So for instance, you would access the functions in the
UFX.random module via the object UFX.random.
